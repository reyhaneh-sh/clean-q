## A Clinic Appointment Reservation Web Application

In this system, *clinics* can create a **dedicated page** including relative information. They can **update their profiles**, as well as see **a list of all reservations** booked by patients.

On the other side, *patients* can **signup**, **login**, and see a **paginated list of available clinics**, **search** on them, see a clinic profile **in detail** and **make a reservation** at a clinic.

In this project, the main focus is on the **back-end** development, so the front-end is simple.
